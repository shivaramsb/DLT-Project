Databricks Declarative Pipelines (Delta Live Tables) Study Guide
I. Core Concepts & Importance
Databricks Declarative Pipelines (DDP) / Delta Live Tables (DLT): A modern, revolutionary ETL framework in Databricks that allows users to declare what they want their data pipelines to do, rather than explicitly coding how it should be done. It handles dependencies, orchestration, and data quality automatically.
High Demand in 2025: DDP/DLT mastery is crucial for data engineers due to recent upgrades, API changes, and its increasing adoption in the big data industry.
Foundation: DDP is built on top of Delta Live Tables, which was previously a standalone concept and has now been contributed to Apache Spark.
Comparison with Traditional Methods: Unlike traditional ETL where every step (load, transform, monitor, quality checks, dependencies) needs manual configuration, DDP simplifies this by allowing simple SQL or Python code to define the desired state, with DLT handling the underlying execution.
Key Phrase: "You just declare what you want and DLT takes care of how it should be done."
II. Key Components & Benefits of DDP/DLT
Streaming Tables:Designed for streaming data and incremental data ingestion.
Processes only new data (change capture), rather than reprocessing all data.
More powerful than Spark Structured Streaming tables for incremental data, even better than Autoloader.
Supports micro-batch processing (milliseconds, seconds).
Materialized Views:Stores the result of a query in a persistent location (like a table).
Ideal for batch processing, as it re-reads all data from the source every time it runs.
Can now also read incremental data with recent upgrades.
Views (Batch Views & Streaming Views):Normal views that store only the query, not the results.
Batch Views: Process data in batches.
Streaming Views: Process data incrementally from streaming sources.
Benefits:Data Quality Checks with Expectations:Built-in support for defining rules (expectations) on data flows.
Rules are SQL boolean statements (e.g., column should never be null, price greater than zero).
Actions for failed expectations:
Warn: Keep the record but issue a warning.
Drop: Drop the corrupted record.
Fail: Fail the entire flow if any record does not meet the expectation.
No extra code needed to handle these actions.
Expectations can be defined using decorators (e.g., @dlt.expect_all_or_drop, @dlt.expect_all_or_fail) or directly within expect_all_or_drop()/expect_all_or_fail() when creating streaming tables.
Automatic Dependency Management (DAGs): DLT automatically identifies and manages the execution order of tasks (Directed Acyclic Graph), eliminating manual configuration.
Incremental Processing (Change Capture): Efficiently processes only new data, crucial for big data scenarios.
Unified Batch and Streaming: Same code can be used for both batch and streaming operations; DLT detects the data source type and handles it accordingly.
Append Flow API: Allows appending data from multiple sources to a single, empty streaming table. This is achieved by creating an empty streaming table as a target and using dlt.append_flow to direct data from various sources to it.
Auto CDC (Change Data Capture) / Apply Changes API:A new API specifically for creating upserted tables (equivalent to SQL MERGE statements).
Requires a target empty streaming table, source, key columns, and a sequence_by column (often a timestamp) to determine the latest record for updates.
Can handle different SCD types (e.g., Type 1).
Eliminates the need for manual CDC logic.

IV. Building a Medallion Architecture with DDP/DLT
Medallion Architecture: A data architecture pattern with three layers: Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned/transformed), and Gold (curated/business-ready).
Bronze Layer:Ingests raw data (e.g., sales data from East and West regions, products, customers).
Uses dlt.create_streaming_table for empty streaming tables and dlt.append_flow to combine and append data from multiple sources.
Applies initial data quality checks using expectations (expect_all_or_drop).
Silver Layer:Cleanses and transforms data from the Bronze layer.
Uses dlt.create_streaming_table for empty streaming tables (enriched tables).
Employs dlt.create_auto_cdc_flow for upserting data (SCD Type 1 behavior) based on key columns and sequence-by columns.
Often involves creating streaming views before the auto_cdc_flow to apply transformations and ensure that only incremental data is passed to the next stage (crucial because auto_cdc_flow outputs an upserted table which can't directly be the source of a streaming table in the next layer if it needs to process only new, append-only data).
Gold Layer (Dimensional Data Model):Curates data for business consumption, typically creating dimension (Dim) and fact (Fact) tables.
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD):Type 1 (SCD1): Overwrites existing data with new values. History is not tracked. Implemented using dlt.create_auto_cdc_flow with type=1. (Already covered in Silver layer for enriched tables).
Type 2 (SCD2): Tracks the full history of changes. New records are inserted, and old records are expired with end_date and is_current flags. Implemented using dlt.create_auto_cdc_flow with type=2. DLT automatically manages start_date, end_date, and is_current columns.
Source for SCD2 tables should be a streaming view (or append-only source) from the Silver layer to ensure only new/changed records are processed effectively.
Fact Tables: Typically created by joining dimension tables to enrich transactional data. Often uses dlt.table for a materialized view (batch processing) to ensure all data is available for aggregations, as incremental processing might not be suitable for business views requiring a complete dataset.
Business Views: Materialized views that aggregate and present data for specific business use cases (e.g., sales by region and category). dlt.table is appropriate for these to ensure full dataset availability.
V. Pipeline Monitoring & Orchestration
Monitoring Canvas: Provides a visual representation of the pipeline run, showing processed records, upserted records, and expectation fulfillment.
Event Logs: Detailed logs for each task/object within the pipeline.
Development vs. Production Modes:Development: Keeps resources active for faster debugging.
Production: Optimizes for cost by shutting down resources when not in use.
Notifications: Configure email notifications for pipeline failures.
Configuration (Parameters): Add key-value pair parameters to the pipeline. Note that all parameters are passed as strings and may require parsing (e.g., splitting into a list, converting JSON strings to dictionaries) within the code.
Scheduling: Schedule pipelines to run automatically at defined intervals.
Integration with Databricks Jobs: DLT pipelines can be embedded and orchestrated as tasks within Databricks Jobs, allowing for complex multi-task workflows.
Resource Management (Free Edition): Be mindful of resource limits; avoid opening too many tabs or running multiple pipelines simultaneously to prevent resource exhaustion. Delete existing pipelines before creating new ones in the free edition.

Answer Key
Fundamental Difference: DLT allows users to declare the desired state or outcome of their data, while traditional ETL requires explicit coding of the steps and logic (how) to achieve that outcome. DLT automatically handles the "how."
Expectations Purpose and Actions: Expectations are built-in rules used for data quality checks on records flowing through a pipeline. If an expectation is not met, DLT can be configured to either "drop" the offending record or "fail" the entire pipeline.
Dependency Management: DLT automatically identifies and manages dependencies between tasks in a pipeline. It constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on how tables and views reference each other in the code, eliminating the need for manual orchestration.
Streaming Table vs. Materialized View: A DLT Streaming Table primarily processes new (incremental) data from a source, capturing changes efficiently. A Materialized View, conversely, traditionally re-reads all data from its source every time it runs, making it suitable for batch processing of complete datasets.
Append Flow API Purpose: The dlt.append_flow API in the Bronze layer is used to combine data from multiple append-only sources into a single target streaming table. It allows various data streams to contribute to a unified initial staging table without complex union logic.
SCD Type 2 Usage and Benefit: You would use dlt.create_auto_cdc_flow with type=2 in the Gold layer to track the full history of changes for a dimension. Its primary benefit is automating the creation and maintenance of start_date, end_date, and is_current columns, which are essential for historical data analysis.
Streaming View as SCD Source: A streaming view is preferred as the source for an SCD Type 2 auto_cdc_flow because streaming views only ingest new or append-only data. An upserted streaming table, if used directly, might not effectively capture all historical changes required for SCD Type 2 due to its update capabilities.
Free Edition Resource Error: Users might encounter "resources are exhausted" errors in the Databricks Free Edition. This can be mitigated by waiting 30-60 minutes for resources to restore or by being mindful not to open too many tabs or run multiple demanding operations concurrently.
Explorations Folder Role: The "explorations" folder in the DLT pipeline asset browser is for notebooks used for quick data checks or experimental code. Notebooks placed here are not part of the DLT pipeline's source code and therefore are not executed when the pipeline runs, saving resources.
Materialized View for Business View: A Materialized View is suitable for a "Business View" in the Gold layer because it stores the entire aggregated result of a query. This ensures that the business view always reflects the complete and up-to-date data from its underlying fact and dimension tables, which is critical for accurate business insights, unlike a Streaming View that only processes incremental data.
